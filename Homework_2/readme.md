This is a code to run homework 2. The code will not run as it has many dependencies on other CSVs which are not currently available on this Github. The code has 2 parts as per the homework specifications:

Part 1: SQL queries to conduct analysis

Part 2: Same data but on cassandra to conduct SQL inquiries with cassandra and pandas data manipulation. 

There is also a dockerfile attached here and a pdf detailing all of my answers. Have fun grading Seb! Also pandas are still the Bain of my existence...
