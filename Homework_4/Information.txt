GenAI Disclosure: 
We used ChatGPT for a variety of purposes in this project. Namely with the following prompts:
1. What does this error mean? Referring to permission issues with the apache
2. How do I check why the code is not running? Like what error is occurring? 
3. Why is Pandas not included in my apache? How do i include that?>
4. Is there a way to test the code or do I just have to rawdog it?
